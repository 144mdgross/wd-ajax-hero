# AJAX Hero

For your exercise today, you will make AJAX calls to the OMDb API using jQuery. The HTML and CSS files are all set up for you, now it's your job to dynamically manipulate the DOM with data returned from an API to create content.

To start off with, your site will look like this:

### Exercise Goals

##### Goal 1:

- Hard code your website to display data without using a search field, e.g. your first call should be a search for "Star Wars"
- Dynamically create content using Materialize elements such as rows, columns, and cards
- Each card should display the movie title, poster, and a link to plot synopsis

> **HINT:** Since not all the poster images returned from OMDb are the same size, feel free to set all your image height/width the same so the cards will align better

##### Goal 2:

- When a user clicks on the "Plot Synopsis" button, display the plot using a modal
- The modal should display the title, release year, and full plot

##### BONUS Goal:

- Add an input field that allows users to search for any movie they'd like

In the end, your website could look something like this, but feel free to get creative with color, design, search features, etc:
